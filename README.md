E155 Lab repository

This repository contains code that was written during the duration of E155, MicroProcessor and FPGA design and Application. The following skills were obtained throughout the duration of these labs: 

Read technical documentation for microcontrollers and other digital chips
Write and interpret clean RTL
Design combinational logic
Design finite state machines
Identify and derisk clock domain crossings and other sources of asynchrony
Program a microcontroller to interact with real-world systems (motors, speakers, etc.) using C
Program a microcontroller using modern techniques like HAL or RTOS
Decide when to use peripherals in a microcontroller circuit
Name and describe common communication protocols and their tradeoffs
Select parts for a large digital system, and decide how to spread computation among those parts
Work with Github and present your work on a portfolio website
Scope, design and implement a digital electronics project!

The average lab time for this class was around 15 hour weekly commitment. This includes the full write-up and code implementation. 

Here is a website containing the necessary details for each lab including schematics, block diagrams, and calculations: https://swayngee.github.io/e155-lab1/
