## Lab 6 - The Internet of Things and Serial Peripheral Interface

## Introduction

In this lab, a design was made to use a microcontroller, the SPI interface, and the UART interface to build and design an IoT device. One first part of this design incorporated an SPI link between the microcontroller and a DS1722 temperature sensor. This link was written over the peripherals, MISO, MOSI, CE, and SYSCLK. The next part was an UART connection between the microcontroller and a ESP8266 wifi module. The wifi module would output the temperature values and the resolution coming from the microcontroller. As the final part of the design, a website was created within the microcontroller to output the temperature values and the user is able to control the temperture resolution, and an onboard LED. 

The design was developed using C on SEGGER, and implemented on an STM32L432KC Microcontroller.

## Results and Discussion



## Conclusion
The design was a success. The microcontroller successfully was linked via SPI to the DS1722, and via UART to the ESP8266. Along with this, a webiste was created successfully to read the temperature values over wifi from the ESP8266, and the user was able to change and control a LED, and the resolution of the temperature sensor. 

This Lab took 12 hours. 

## Suggestions
To, in future labs, better understand the SPI interface beforehand and understand how it compares to other communication protocols such as I2C.
